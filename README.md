Breadboard Microcontroller Starter Kit:

The Breadboard Microcontroller Starter Kit provides everything you need to get started in the exciting world of microcontroller programming. With this kit, you will master the basics of circuit design, create a programmable circuit on the breadboard, and learn to write C programs for microcontrollers. The kit provides everything you need for basic input and output control. Control LEDs, gather input from button switches, display text on an LCD, make sounds from a speaker, make working light and temperature sensors, create a digital stopwatch, program your own Simon-style repetition game, and more! The Starter Kit components also can be used as a controller for Machine Science's robotics projects. This kit is an outstanding value at just $99.

What's Included

Breadboard
Flexible jump wire set
Pre-bent jump wire set
Resistors (various values)
Microcontroller (ATmega168)
Liquid crystal display (LCD)
Seven segment display
Button switches
Capacitors
Light sensor
Temperature sensor
LEDs
Piezospeaker
Bent header (36-pin)
Programming board (USB)

Battery pack with switch


-----------
Robot Base Kit:

The Robot Base Kit transforms the Breadboard Microcontroller Starter Kit or the XIPMods Master Module into the control center for a programmable robot, providing an engaging introduction to the field of robotics. This package provides all of the mechanical components for the robot, including an aluminum chassis, two servo motors, two wheels, a front caster, and mounting hardware. Measuring 8.75" by 5.25" by 1.75", the anodized aluminum chassis is extremely rugged and will withstand years of use.

What's Included

Aluminum chassis
Servo motors (2)
Disc wheels (2)
Plastic caster (1)
Aluminum standoffs (4)
Cotter pin
Velcro strip
Nuts and bolts



-----------
Sensor Expansion Pack:

The Sensor Expansion Pack adds an exciting level of functionality to the mobile robot: the ability to respond to the environment. Two types of sensors are included in this package: a forward-facing infrared analog distance sensor that keeps the robot from bumping into walls and objects in its path, and two down-facing infrared reflectance sensors that keep the robot from falling down stairs (or off tables). The down-facing sensors also give the robot the ability to track lines. The Sensor Expansion Pack is compatible with both the Breadboard Starter Kit and the XIPMods Master Module.

What's Included

Front-facing infrared analog distance sensor
Down-facing infrared reflectance sensors (2)
Mechanical fasteners


-----------
Remote Control Expansion Pack:

The Remote Control Expansion Pack provides direct command over every movement of the robot, using an infrared remote control. The illustrated guide for this project provides instructions for attaching an infrared receiver to the robot, decoding signals from the remote control, and programming the robot to respond to these signals. Along the way, the fundamentals of serial data transmission are covered, as well as lessons on the binary number system.

What's Included

Universal remote control
Infrared sensor
